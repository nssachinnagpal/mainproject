<p>
 Points of view in favor of:

<li> 1) People feel that robots will never lead to unemplyment as there will be more employment created in the field of arts, literature.</li>
<li> 2) People feel that all hardships jobs should be taken by robots and those jobs which involve thinking, analyzing, applying should be given to humans.</li>
<li> 3) People feel that humans are unnecessarily wasting their thinking power by doing hardships jobs, infact they can use the time well and think of someting that would help avoid global problems like pollution, global warming etc. </li>

</p>



<p>
Points of view in opposition of:


<li> 1) People feel that as each day moves robots are squeezing out jobs slowly in every field, let it be working in manufacturing industry or hospitals and many other places.  </li>
<li> 2) Robots are machines, they are programmed in a way to do so, they don't get tired. </li>
<li> 3) Robots can do the same work thousands times, they don't get bored. </li>
<li> 4) This massive development in the robotics is never a good sign for humans, people will die of hunger. </li>
</p>

<p> What happens if all the jobs are taken by robots:
<li>
If robots do all the work humans will have no work and they will use the time in enjoying, moving here and there, enjoying life. Humans will have so much of time free, in which they will not understand what to do. Next point would be if people don’t go to work who will give them money and how will they survive to meet their basic needs. If you have a robot at home who gives you a coffee when you want, it gives you food when you want, to make food we need raw materials, to make a coffee we need coffee powder, you need electricity to run that robot, how will you provide these inputs if you don’t have money. There should be some sort of employment to humans to earn money.
</li>
