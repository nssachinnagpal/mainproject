<ul>
<li> Me: Hello how are you doing brother </li>

<li> Me: I am good </li>
<li> Me: I actually came to know about you from one of my friends who is working in Intel, you live in these apartments, I never knew about you, I am sorry </li>
<li> Danny: It's fine, I even never knew about you, you live here itself, I should have known about you </li>
<li> Me: Can I ask you some questions about my class project? </li>
<li> Danny: Yeah, sure brother, I would love that </li>
<li> Me: What are about your views about this robots in concern with unemployment, I think you are the right person whom should I ask </li>
<li> Danny: Yeah, I am working at Intelli-sense technology at Intel, we are dealing with products which can work at our sense. </li>
<li> Danny: I really think, while working on it, robots are going to take away almost all jobs by the end of 2050, the pace at which they are expanding is overwhelming, I have some ideas about how we can protect people from loosing their jobs, I am going to present this paper next month in sunnyvale in a small conference. I have idea that we should from now itself encourage small children about arts, literature etc. which are becoming extinct slowly </li>
<li> Danny: My idea is that we should protect people from loosing their jobs, this is really important, better you attend my talk next month know </li>
<li> Me: Yeah, sure </li>
