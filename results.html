The young generation is very crazy about the upcoming robots. They want the life to be very easy. From the day they are born they are seeing tablets, smartphones, they are used to this fast technology and they know how the life is easier, but this robotic revolution is in a way that it’s evolution it’s not good for humans, it will infact ruin human life. But the people who are in their middle ages who have some kind of sense are really concerned about the impact of this revolution. They are really concerned how the young generation would lead their life if all jobs are taken by robots. Sensible people who are into technology are taking out research how to limit the usage of robotic technology, and find a better place to use it instead of using it everywhere.
