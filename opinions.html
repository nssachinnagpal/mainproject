<p>
The evolution of robots and its concern in helping humans in doing heavy tasks is really a good idea, but there should be some kind of limit to the evolution of robots, somewhere sometimes the invention about something should not be patented, like Queen Elizabeth who did not allow patent for the knitting machine invented by William Lee thinking that would make an end of jobs in that field. There should be a debate in which we should discuss to what extent the robotic technology should be used and to what extent it should be stopped.
