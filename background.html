<p>Each and every scientist from the past centuries are trying to invent a thing that would make people's life easier, but they never thought that this would squeeze out jobs for day to day living. There are few sensible rulers who actually thought about their people by rejecting patents that would make an end of common jobs. Like Queen Elizabeth I rejected the patent of 'William Lee' who invented a knitting machine. From thousands of years ago man is evolving very fast, inventing things that would make life easier, it's a good choice, but inventing something that would take away human based jobs is ridiculous. Roman emperor ‘Vespasian’ refused an invention to enable low cost transportation of heavy goods saying “You must allow my poor hauliers to earn their bread.”  This problem of unemployment is not a modern problem, it is a problem that is lasting from 16th century, it is clear from the book of ‘Aristotle’ ‘One of Politics’ that if machines become sufficiently advanced there would be no more need of human labour. Before the 19th century,  the ruling officials  were completely opposing the fact that machines can be used to manufacture equipments on a large scale. In the 19th century, there was a sudden  industrial revolution through which many jobs in the manufacturing industry were lost. This revolution was unstoppable, suddenly it evolved so that no one of able to stop it and slowly it transferred to the underdeveloped, developing countries. Great Britain had an extraordinary role in spreading industrial revolution.
